## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It is important to always make the page responsive so that users can view the webpage via mobile, tablet, and/or desktop and the appearance shouldn't break.

I used this code:

````css
.card {
  width: min(350px, 90%);
}
````
